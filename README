Howto:

run activemq
goto admin panel
run application
look to the /data/output data



config/ActiveMQConfig.java - responsible for configuration of Activemq component
routing/CamelRouting.java - configures camel pipelines
DemoApplication.java - starts Spring Boot container

resources/application.yml - defines 3 profiles: development, staging and production.
                            allows additional configuration of databases etc.
                            in this case: introduces activemq endpoint and login data
